# CUSTOMER-LOAN-DATABASE-MANAGEMENT

The primary objective is to organize, store, and fetch data related to customers, loans, states, and branches, enabling the establishment to generate valuable insights. this design is established to handle the creation and management of a database of a database system designed to handle customer and loan details for a financial establishment.

**Report of the Database** 

  The project involves a sequential method of creating a database design and implementing the design.
  
1.	**Creation of Tables and Data Insertion:** tables were created using the necessary procedure and data were inserted into the tables created.
   
2.	**Customer Loan Analysis:**  Identifies customers with the same loan, providing insights into potential customers from its loan for standardization. Retrieves the second-highest customer with its loan and branch for easy identification.

5.	**Create view for the table:** the view implementation is use to extract the loan of a certain amount for clarification which is use for organizational needs.
   
6.	**Stored Procedure Implementation**: Procedures were developed to automate business logic, including updating loan interest rates and retrieving loan details with error handling.
